encodering
==========

Yet another LED ring for encoders.

Features:

- LEDs in a ring (30 by default - but the LED layout is autogenerated)
- I2C based communication saving pins on your microcontroller
- Analog voltage output for simulated potentiometer

I2C protocol
------------

Write access:

- Write: [register] [data] [data...]

Read access:

- Write: [register]
- Read: [data] [data...]

Register point is auto-incremented.

A read transaction without a preceding write transaction always starts from
address 0, so for just polling the status and counter bits, no write is needed.

I2C registers
-------------

All multi-byte values are little endian (LSB first).

Types:

- RW = Read/write
- R = Read only
- RW/NV = Read/write non-volatile. Persisted by "save" command and automatically restored on reset.
- RW/V = Read/write volatile. Value may be changed by device.

The default reset value for all registers is 0 unless otherwise specified.

| address |   type  | description   |
| ------- | --- | ------------- |
| 0x00    | RW/V    | counter value |
| 0x02    |     | event flags   |
| 3-4     |     | min value     |
| 5-6     |     | max value     |
| 7       |     | min LED index |
| 8       |     | max LED index |
